## Abstract
	This project is designed to allow a user to generate their own ideas and save and modify them by interacting with the page. 

  Upon page load, the user will see a fairly empty page. The user will have the ability to enter their own title, and body and generate a card by pressing the **Save** button at the top center of the page. 

  The user can generate as many cards as they would like, and the cards will appear in the card section at the bottom half of the page. 

  Once the card has been created, the user can click the **Star Button** to favorite and unfavorite an idea card at their discretion. Once a star is favorited, the star will turn Orange!
  
  Users also have the ability to delete any card that they have created by clicking the **X** button at the top right corner of a given card. 

  Finally, the cards that a user creates will persist upon page refresh. The page will remember which ideas a user has generated, favorited, or deleted.

## Wins
  - Completed iterations 1 - 3 and completed half of iteration 4 (the local storage implementation).
	- Gained valuable experience in the challenges of group dynamics, scheduling, working asyncronously vs syncronously.
  - Learned a lot about how much work it is to have a DOM that accurately reflects your Data Model
  - gained some valuable first-hand experience in implementing local storage into a live project. 
  - ran an effective process with working in separate branches, opening pull requests with proper comments, and merging branches on GitHub only with others present.

## Challenges + Improvements
	- Working asyncronously vs syncronously. Group scheduling conflicts made it difficult for us to find many times where all 3 of us could be present and working at the exact same time.
  - Because of this and the challenge of the project, we unfortunately did not finish the entire spec. We fully completed iterations 0-3, but we only got halfway through iteration 4 (the local storage features) but were not able to complete the filtering functionalities in iteration 4, or any of iteration 5.
